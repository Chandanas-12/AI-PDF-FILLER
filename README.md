# AI-PDF-FILLER
This project automates filling PDF forms by extracting data from a structured text file. It reads a PDF with fillable fields, parses company and financial data from the text, and populates the PDF accordingly. The filled PDF is then saved, automating form completion with external data, while handling errors like missing data or incorrect formats.
